# team
Team is a cmd line tool for managing a team in a convenient and hacky way. 
## Design
Team will be built on top of Sqlite, and provide a set of common APIs I as a manager usually need. For instance:
1. Input and query notes for a team member or a project
2. Ownership map between projects and team members
3. Managing the projects and workloads for each team member
