It turned out that this old project can be totally impelemnted by ChatGPT. Here is the chat history I guided it to generate this software (not including the actual code). 


Q: I am an engineering manager. I want you to help me write a python software where I can manage my team. I will provide the key functionalities. 
A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Please provide me with the key functionalities you want in the software, and any additional information that might be helpful for me to understand your requirements.

Q: The software will be used in cmd format, the software name is called "team"
A: Got it. What are the key functionalities you want in the "team" software? Here are some common functionalities that might be helpful for managing a team:

  I need the "member detail" to contain following informations for each member:
  1. A history of 1:1 notes (keyed by date)
  2. The member's career goal
